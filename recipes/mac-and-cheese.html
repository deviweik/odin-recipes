        but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when 
        you make this crowd-pleasing homemade mac and cheese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Boil the noodles</strong>: Boil the macaroni in 
            salted water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and 
            transfer to a prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the cheese sauce</strong>: Melt butter, 
            then whisk in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a 
            simmer, and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and 
            pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. 
            Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.
        </li>

            <strong>Make the topping</strong>: Melt two tablespoons 
            of butter in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast 
            until the crumbs are brown. Spread the topping over the 
            macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake the mac and cheese</strong>: Bake in the 
            preheated oven until the topping is golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of 
            lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. 
            Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a 
            medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir 
            until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 
            3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, 
            and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely 
            grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. 
            Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and 
            sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup 
            more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and 
            stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter 
            in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and 
            stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over 
            macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown 
            and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
